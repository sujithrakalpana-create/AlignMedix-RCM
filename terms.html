        <h2>4. Services</h2>
        <p>
          All revenue cycle management (RCM), credentialing, and virtual assistance services are subject to:

  channels is handled in accordance with HIPAA-aligned best practices and industry standards.
</p>
        <h2>5. Limitations of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          AlignMedix RCM is not responsible for delays or losses caused by external systems, including EMRs,
          clearinghouses, payers, or inaccurate information provided by the client. We are not liable for
          indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from use of our services or website.

        <h2>7. Service &amp; Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>
          RCM and related services are professional service-based offerings. As such:

        <ul>
          <li>Completed work is non-refundable.</li>
          <li>Monthly retainers may be billed in advance as per contract terms.</li>
          <li>Task-based work may be billed after completion or as mutually agreed.</li>

          If the provider terminates the agreement mid-cycle, unused days or hours are typically non-refundable,
          unless otherwise stated in the signed contract.
        </p>
        <p>
          While we guarantee timely communication, accurate workflows, and HIPAA-aligned processes, we cannot
          guarantee payer processing speeds, approval of all claims, or overturn of all denials.
        </p>
        <p>
          Either party may terminate the agreement with written notice, as outlined in the service contract.
        </p>
